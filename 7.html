    <p>Canceled a hot hipster threesome for you</p>
    <p>'Cause I preach of freedom, but you're a fucking great excuse</p>
    <p>Plus I'd rather get naked and swim in your blow-up pool</p>
    <p>And dry our dolphin bodies off and question your tattoos</p>
    <p>'Cause he's so pretty when he goes down on me</p>
    <p>Gold-skinned eager baby, blue shirt out the laundry</p>
    <p>He tells me he's gentle when he wants to be</p>
    <p>So I think he wants to be gentle with me</p>
    <p>It's such a short drive to get to the touch tank</p>
    <p>To you, deep sea pearl, my soft manta ray (Manta ray)</p>
    <p>Tender two fingers to touch the display</p>
    <p>I used to dive deep 'til I got splashed in the face</p>
    <p>He's so pretty when he goes down on me</p>
    <p>Gold-skinned eager baby, blue shirt out the laundry</p>
    <p>He tells me he's gentle when he wants to be</p>
    <p>So I think he wants to be gentle with me</p>
    <p>You took my breath away</p>
    <p>So now I can't suck in my stomach around you anymore</p>
    <p>We're too old to live with our parents</p>
    <p>Do you wanna wake up to me every morning?</p>
    <p>Every morning</p>
    <p>Every morning</p>
    <p>I'm swimming into you</p>
    <p>I'll tumble to the ocean in a parachute</p>
    <p>I am swimming into you</p>
    <p>I'll tumble to the ocean</p>
    <p>He's so pretty when he goes down on me</p>
    <p>Gold-skinned eager baby, blue shirt out the laundry</p>
    <p>He tells me he's gentle when he wants to be</p>
