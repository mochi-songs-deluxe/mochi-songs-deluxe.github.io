    <p>Let's go, girls</p>
    <p>Let's go, girls</p>
    <p>Saw a poster on the corner opposite the motel</p>
    <p>Turns out, I'm going to hell if I keep on being myself</p>
    <p>Don't know what I did, but they seem pretty mad about it</p>
    <p>God hates us? Alright then, buckle up, at dawn we're riding</p>
    <p>Walk a mile on these coals, busy cleansing my soul</p>
    <p>Getting ready for the night</p>
    <p>Damned for eternity, but you're coming with me</p>
    <p>Into the afterlife</p>
    <p>This hell is better with you</p>
    <p>We're burning up together, baby, that makes two</p>
    <p>'Cause the devil's wearing Prada and loves a little drama, ooh-ooh</p>
    <p>This hell is better with you</p>
    <p>With you (whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)</p>
    <p>With you (whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)</p>
    <p>Oh, with you (whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)</p>
    <p>This hell is better with you, haha</p>
    <p>Flame red, caught the moment, posing for the paparazzi</p>
    <p>Fuck what they did to Britney, to Lady Di', and Whitney</p>
    <p>Don't know why we're here, but might as well get down and dirty</p>
    <p>That Satan's looking thirsty, not even he can hurt me</p>
    <p>Walk a mile on these coals, busy cleansing my soul</p>
    <p>Getting ready for the night</p>
    <p>Damned for eternity, but you're coming with me</p>

    <p>We're burning up together, baby, that makes two</p>
    <p>'Cause the devil's wearing Prada and loves a little drama, ooh-ooh</p>
    <p>This hell is better with you (with you)</p>
    <p>This life gave us nothing to lose</p>
    <p>We're going down together, got a ticket for two</p>
    <p>'Cause the devil's wearing Prada and loves a little drama, ooh-ooh</p>
    <p>This hell is better with you</p>
