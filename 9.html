    <p>Well, can't you see that it's just rainin'?</p>
<p>There ain't no need to go outside</p>
<p>But baby</p>
<p>You hardly even notice</p>
<p>When I try to show you this</p>
<p>Song is meant to keep you</p>
<p>Doin' what you're supposed to</p>
<p>Wakin' up too early</p>
<p>Maybe we could sleep in</p>
<p>Make you banana pancakes</p>
<p>Pretend like it's the weekend now</p>
<p>We could pretend it all the time</p>
<p>Can't you see that it's just rainin'?</p>
<p>There ain't no need to go outside</p>
<p>But just maybe</p>
<p>Halaka ukulele, mama made a baby</p>
<p>Really don't mind the practice</p>
<p>'Cause you're my little lady</p>
<p>Lady, lady love me</p>
<p>'Cause I love to lay here lazy</p>
<p>We could close the curtains</p>
<p>Pretend like there's no world outside</p>
<p>Then we could pretend it all the time</p>
<p>And can't you see that it's just rainin'?</p>
<p>There ain't no need to go outside</p>
<p>Ain't no need, ain't no need</p>
<p>Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm</p>
<p>Can't you see, can't you see?</p>
<p>Rain all day and I don't mind</p>
<p>But the telephone's singing, ringing</p>
<p>It's too early, don't pick it up</p>
<p>We don't need to</p>
<p>We got everything we need right here</p>
<p>And everything we need is enough</p>
<p>Just so easy when the whole world fits inside of your arms</p>
<p>Do we really need to pay attention to the alarm?</p>
<p>Wake up slow</p>
<p>Mmm-mmm, wake up slow</p>
<p>But baby</p>
<p>You hardly even notice</p>
<p>When I try to show you this</p>
<p>Song is meant to keep you</p>
<p>From doin' what you're supposed to</p>
<p>Wakin' up too early</p>
<p>Maybe we could sleep in</p>
<p>Make you banana pancakes</p>
<p>Pretend like it's the weekend now</p>
<p>We could pretend it all the time</p>
<p>Can't you see that it's just rainin'</p>
<p>There ain't no need to go outside</p>
<p>Ain't no need, ain't no need</p>
<p>Rain all day and I really, really, really don't mind</p>
<p>Can't you see, can't you see?</p>
<p>We gotta wake up slow</p>
